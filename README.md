# LT-LBP

Among the various preprocessing of image Local Binary Pattern was fluently used as a local image descriptor. Other preprocessing methods we have referred to as Clipping the Hounsfield units, normalization, and resampling The local binary pattern was introduced by Ojala et al in 1996 and used as an adequate feature extractor. LBP was designed for monochrome images. It has been used in many applications because of its computational simplicity, invariance to grayscale changes, and high discriminative power. LBP for preprocessing as texture identification can be chosen. The generic formula for LBP is given by

According to the logarithmic and exponential rule, for every real number b, x and n

The LT-LBP is formed in Equation 5 by using the fundamental logarithmic characteristics from Equation 4 from Equation 2.
